Taskset Simulator and Virtual-Gang Combination Generator for RTG-Synch

The purpose of the simulator is the following: Given a candidate taskset
generate all possible virtual-gang combinations. Using a brute-force approach,
determine the virtual-gang combination which gives the smallest cumulative
execution time for the entire taskset.

The optimal solution given by the simulator can be used to evaluate heuristic
and greedy algorithm based solutions.
